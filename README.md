### Welcome to my personal research for project 2 of my Videogame Development Degree.

In this research i'll talk about how to reduce some operations like collisions in 2D games using space partitioning systems like **Quadtree**. I'll also explain how the **Quadtrees** works and you can do an **Exercise** to implement it in your project.
